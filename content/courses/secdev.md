# Course Recommendations
Due to the nature and complexity of the Security Development Program, prospective students interested in taking the Security Development Program should evaluate his/her own skills using the table below.  Each student should have at least 6 points before attempting SecDev as the individuals are role models and will be taking on a self motivated education. If an individual does not meet the recommended points, he/she can still join but will be held to the same standards as a fellow SecDev student. Failure to meet responsibilities will be confronted in a meeting.  Continuation will result in asking the student to step down to another program.

# Course Requirements
You must have taken either Systems Security or Network Security in Fall 2016 or later.

# Course Conduct
## Academic Integrity
Students must conduct their coursework in a manner that does not violate the University at Buffalo’s Academic Integrity Policy.  Students found in violation of the [Academic Integrity Policy](http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/course/integrity.html) will receive an F for the course.

## Ethics Policy
As a student in cyber security, you are learning tools and given resources that are meant to help protect yourself and others. However, these tools and resources can also be used in malicious or illegal ways. It is imperative that while you are a representative of this class, and even well after, you perform any security education or training strictly inside our internal environment or a controlled and contained environment that you have prepared for yourself. Any activity outside of our internal environment is outside of our control and protection. If you are not sure what you’re doing, it is very easy to do something illegal without even knowing you are (even something as simple as port scanning outside our internal network). If you are unsure if something is allowed or not, contact one of the instructors or mentors. **All network traffic inside our infrastructure will be monitored for malicious or suspicious activity and acted upon with severe consequences if such privileges are abused.** You are being given an opportunity to learn, please do not waste it.

## vCenter Usage
As a part of the Security Development Program, you are granted elevated permissions permissions inside the vCenter environment.  Any misuse of the environment will result in the **immediate failure of the student, as well as academic dishonesty charges being filed.**

## Network Logging Disclaimer
All traffic that occurs within the vCenter environment is being **logged** for analysis purposes.  Traffic captures (pcaps) may be shared with other individuals within UBNetDef for educational purposes only. **We highly discourage logging into any personal or social networking websites on a Virtual Machine hosted in the vCenter environment.**
